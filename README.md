# Monty Python's FriendFinder

This app serves as a personality test to find your ideal Monty Python viewing partner. Take a quick, ten-question survey which records your responses to various Pythonesque situations, and the person who answered closest to you is displayed. As more users complete the questionnaire, more people are added to the app's databse for comparison.

*Monty Python's FriendFinder* is built using Express.js and Bootstrap. The server's logic & boilerplate code is in *server.js*. The html displayed to the user by the server is stored in */app/public/* and the server routes are stored in */app/routing/*. The server's database of friends is kept in */app/data/friends.js*.
